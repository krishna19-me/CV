                <h3>Design & Development</h3>
                <p>I started to learn code when I was 10 years old because I wanted create my own Apps and Games. When I join a coding class my teacher told me that these codes were created to communicate with machines. When I joined the class, I was learning
                    python. After a year only, I started to learn html and css. I have created this web site using what I learnt.</p>

                <h3>Read & Write Stories</h3>
                <p>In sixth, when the corona lockdown was going on, I started a new hait to read story books. Soon, the interest in the habbit lead me to write stories on my own. My first story was "The weird dream". It was about Ajay's freind, Rithik's
                    dream. My second story was "The Mirror world". It was about a boy who went to a world, which was created by his father, whlie playing. </p>

                <h3>Carnatic Music</h3>
                <p>When I was 7 years old, I joined a music class. In the class she taught us only songs. After 6 months I left the class and joined another class. He taught us both carnatic music and songs. From that day onwards I loved carnatic music very
                    much. Due to corona, I left the class and joined another class. She also taught us both carnatic music and songs. Still I am learning and continuing to improve.</p>
